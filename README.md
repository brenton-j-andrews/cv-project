A resume generator completed with React. 

Working demo: (https://brenton-j-andrews.github.io/cv-project/)

This was my first project using React and there are many areas that can be improved upon. I am a bit tired of working on this one now, and will implement the changes below sometime soon.

Project TODO: 
1. Take all repeated Component class methods and package them into one subclass that Resume Components can be extended from. This will reduce repeating quite a bit!
2. Add a PDF generator.
3. Fix the form positioning for the left boxes.
4. Change the resume display sizing for larger / wider monitors.
